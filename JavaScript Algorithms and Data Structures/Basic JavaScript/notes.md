**General Syntax**

- We use `//` to make an inline comment and `/* */` to create a multi-line comment.

**Variables**

- Eight different data types include:
    1. `undefined`
    2. `null`
    3. `boolean`
    4. `string`
    5. `symbol`
    6. `bigint`
    7. `number`
    8. `object`
- Unlike Java, JavaScript is **dynamically typed** i.e variable types are checked during run-time and don't need to be explicitly typed.
- Variables are similar to x & y variables in Maths. It allows computers to store and manipulate data by pointing a reference to the data.
- Variables in JS can start with numbers, letters `$` and `_` but cannot container spaces or start with a number.
- If you create variables that rely on the result of a calculation to produce a value, this calculation will occur first prior to assignment.
- Declared variables have an initial value of `undefined`.
- Variables are case sensitive meaning `myVar`, `myVAR` and `MYVAR` are all three different and independent variables.

**Arithmetic Operations**

- Incrementing can be done using the `++` operator. `i++` is the equivalent of `i = i + 1`.
- We can intialise a floating-point value to a variable dynamically.
- The `%` operator gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. Tip: The remainder operator is often incorrectly referred to as a the modulus operator, it is similar but does not work properly with negative number

**Operators**

- `+=` conducts a mathematical operation and resassignment of a variable in one step.
- `-=` does the same thing but for subtraction.
