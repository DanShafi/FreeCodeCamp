**General Syntax**

- We use `//` to make an inline comment and `/* */` to create a multi-line comment.

**Data Types**

- Eight different data types include:
    1. `undefined`
    2. `null`
    3. `boolean`
    4. `string`
    5. `symbol`
    6. `bigint`
    7. `number`
    8. `object`
- Unlike Java, JavaScript is **dynamically typed** i.e variable types are checked during run-time and don't need to be explicitly typed.
